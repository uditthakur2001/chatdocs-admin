# 🤖 ChatDocs – AI-Powered Document Q&A App

**ChatDocs** is an intelligent AI-powered platform that allows users to upload documents and ask natural language questions about their content. Built with **Streamlit**, it combines **FAISS** for semantic search, **Google Gemini AI** for answering queries, and **PostgreSQL (Neon DB)** for persistent storage of chats and file metadata. Whether it's PDFs, Word docs, Excel sheets, or CSVs — ChatDocs helps users interact with their documents like never before.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/uditthakur2001/chatdocs-admin.git
cd chatdocs-admin
```

### 2. (Optional) Create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv venv
# Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up environment variables
Create a .env file in the root directory and add your DB credentials:

```bash
POSTGRES_HOST=your_neon_host
POSTGRES_DB=your_database_name
POSTGRES_USER=your_username
POSTGRES_PASSWORD=your_password
POSTGRES_PORT=5432
```
### 5. Run the application

```bash
streamlit run main.py
```

## 🧠 How It Works
Admin uploads documents via the UI.

Metadata and chat history are stored in PostgreSQL (Neon DB).

Semantic embeddings are generated with FAISS.

Google Gemini AI handles user queries based on vector search results.

Document and user records are searchable and editable via the admin interface.

## 📌 Roadmap
 Admin authentication system

 Document versioning and tagging

 Activity analytics and user stats

 Integration with cloud object storage (S3, GCS, etc.)
